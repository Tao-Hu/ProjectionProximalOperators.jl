# ProjectionProximalOperators.jl

Projection and proximal operators play central role in many algorithms in modern statistics and machine learning. Good examples are [ADMM](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/admm.html) (alternating direction method of multipliers) and [proximal algorithms](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/prox_algs.html).

I construct a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package for most often used projection and proximal operators. See documentation [here](https://github.com/Tao-Hu/ProjectionProximalOperators.jl/blob/master/document.pdf).

An [example](https://github.com/Tao-Hu/ProjectionProximalOperators.jl/blob/master/lrg_max.ipynb) is also provided to demonstrate the usage of this package.
